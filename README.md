# Shack-Hartmann-wavefront-sensor-centroid-algorithms-GCP
we present a GCP centroid algorithm to accurately locate the spot centroids of SHWS images under high to extremely low SNR conditions. The GCP method is a piecewise algorithm that enables accurate and quick computation of all spot centroids using a single method. Especially under low SNR conditions (SNRâ‰¤3), the GCP method uses a Padding strategy to accurately estimate the centroids of these spots with the information of neighboring spot shifts.
